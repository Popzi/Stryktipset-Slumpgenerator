# Stryktipset slumpgenerator

This was written in the course Script programming and Internet applications.
The task was to analyze a dataset of chickens and determine the best feed for them.


I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script
